# Python Piscine for Data Science

## About the project

The **Python Piscine for Data Science** is a 42Network project composed of five modules designed to introduce and explore the Python programming language.

## Getting started 

Run the exercises in a virtual environment to use `flake8` norm:

```bash
python3 -m virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

```bash
pip install flake8
```
