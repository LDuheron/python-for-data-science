# About the project

The **Python Piscine for Data Science** is a 42Network project composed of five modules designed to introduce and explore the Python programming language.

I started this project by following **Neetcode**'s courses **Python for Beginners** and **Python OOP***. Available here : https://neetcode.io/courses

Below is the list of additional resources I used while completing each module.
